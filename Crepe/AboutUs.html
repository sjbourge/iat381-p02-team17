<h3> Who Are We?</h3>
<p> Pollyanna's Crepes was founded in 2003 in Vancouver's Yaletown district. Since then we have relocated three times, until we finally found our current home on Robson Street, in the heart of Vancouver. Our goal has always been, and will always be, to create delicious crepes that are also health concious. We use only fresh ingredients, and local whenever available. Our chocolate, vanilla and caramel sauces are made in-house and fresh every morning. We take the traditional French art of crepe baking and give it a Vancouver twist, for example have you tried our Maple Salmon Crepe? 
</p>
<h3> How do we make low calorie crepes?</h3>
<p> It might seem impossible to some, but yes its true - we have a selection of <em>healthy</em> crepes! We use whole grain flour mixed with almond milk, free range egg whites and low fat margarine to make a significantly lighter batter than a traditional crepe. We also use natural sweetners such as honey and berry juice instead of sugar or Splenda. The result is a serious reduce in calories in our dough. Next, we only use fresh fruit which has been grown without genetic modification, and all our meats are free range. This way your concience and your waistline can rest assured, we've got your backs. As for our signature chocolate and vanilla sauces, we use fair trade cocoa and vanilla beansand slowly melt them into an almond and honey mixture. And last, but certainly not least, our maple syrup is always pure and traditional, specially delivered from Trois-Rivieres, Quebec.
</p>
<h3> What is our place in the Vancouver community?</h3>
<p> Besides offering delicious, healthy food we also do a lot more for our beloved hometown. We strongly support local farms and farmers, purchasing only fair trade products. We also host monthly Charity Days where 20% of the day's income will go directly to a local charity. Besides all that, we also host a by donation cooking class once a month, where the proceeds support the local food bank.
