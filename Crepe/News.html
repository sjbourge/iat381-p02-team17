We would like to announce that we have a new chef on staff! Please join us in welcoming Winnie Teng, a culinary graduate of the Paris Institue for Culinary Arts. Born and raised in Vancouver, Winnie traveled to France to learn the art of crepe making. Now she returns to BC with a whole bunch of delicious skills she is excited to share with all of you. Look for her behind the counter starting this month!
